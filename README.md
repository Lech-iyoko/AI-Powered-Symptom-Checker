# AI-Powered Symptom Checker 🏥🤖

This project aims to develop a symptom checker assistant that predicts potential conditions or outcomes based on textual symptom descriptions. Using NLP and machine learning, the model analyzes patient data to support decision-making in healthcare.

🔹 Why this matters? AI-driven healthcare tools can enhance **diagnosis accuracy, reduce patient wait times, and assist medical professionals** by providing initial symptom assessments.

### 🗂 Dataset: MedText
  📌 Name: MedText Dataset
  📌 Size: 1.4k rows, 2 columns

* Columns
  📝 Prompt: Text describing patient symptoms, history, or complaints.
  📊 Completion: The most likely outcome or diagnosis for the given prompt.
  🔍 Data Content: Covers 100+ common diseases and 30 frequent injuries.


### 🎯 Objective
Build an AI-powered symptom checker that:
✅ Predicts potential conditions based on input symptoms.
✅ Handles textual data efficiently for better insights.
✅ Serves as a foundation for scalable healthcare AI applications.

### 📌 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Collection & Preprocessing
Handle missing data, duplicates, inconsistencies.
Text cleaning: Remove punctuation, stopwords, and normalize text.
Tokenization & Vectorization: Convert text into numerical representations.
🛠 Tools: pandas, textacy, nltk, spacy

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Pattern analysis: Identify key trends in symptom descriptions.
Entity recognition: Extract medical terms.
Visualization: Charts & word distributions.
🛠 Tools: matplotlib, seaborn, spacy

3️⃣ Feature Engineering
Convert text into TF-IDF vectors & word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe).
Explore n-grams to capture phrase-level insights.

4️⃣ Model Development
* Train models:
  - ✅ Logistic Regression
  - ✅ Random Forest
  - ✅ Deep Learning: RNN, LSTM, Transformers (BERT, BioBERT)
  - Optimize for accuracy, precision, recall, and generalizability.
🛠 Tools: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers

5️⃣ Model Evaluation
Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.
Compare different models to select the best performer.

🖥 Deployment Strategy
💡 Inference API Deployment → Hugging Face
🔹 Backend API → FastAPI
🔹 Conversational UI → Gradio (Hugging Face Spaces)

🔗 How It Works?
1️⃣ User inputs symptoms into the UI.
2️⃣ The model refines input & suggests follow-ups (LLM integration).
3️⃣ The ML model predicts possible conditions.
4️⃣ A user-friendly response is generated & displayed.
